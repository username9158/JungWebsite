    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Video games are one of my few hobbies. Among them, <strong>Dark Souls III</strong> is a video game that I have been enjoying for a long time. <strong>Dark Souls III</strong> is a game that has a maniac people. Dark vibes,  hardest difficulty, and magnificent background music makes us keep tension, and feels like we are fighting directly in the game. When every sequel comes out, the game's graphics improve continually, and give us to perfect strong storyline every times. Finally they made a masterpiece at third work.
